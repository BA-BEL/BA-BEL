My name is Bilal 'Bel' Abdul Hak. I am a Laws and Commerce student at Monash University and also a budding data analyst. I'm very interested in the world of data and hope to use it throughout my entire career. I took notice of the power of data around three years ago, dabbling with R and Excel. Now, after an intensive training program by my university, I've dipped a few more toes into this world and am excited to put my newfound skills to test!
